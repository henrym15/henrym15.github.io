        <p class="paragraph"> The importance of having a local public library cannot be understated.
            Even in our modern world, where our phones store all of the information we could ever possibly 
            want to know, having a physical location is paramount to building equitable access to information
            for everyone. Not only does it promote accessibility, but the sense of community is something
            that cannot be replicated digitally.

            <br><br>

            Growing up, I was lucky enough to have lived near a public library. I would visit with my sister
            nearly every week, borrowing books, printing research papers for our school projects, and participating
            in community-led events. During my sophomore year of high school, I was actually fortunate enough to be 
            on the teen council, where I was able to volunteer my time to beautifying the surrounding area and managing 
            the circulation of new books.

            <br><br>

            That's all to say that while I primarily visited my library for the purposes of reading, the things I 
            contributed to and gained experience in expanded far beyond that. A library isn't just a place to borrow books --
            it can be a place to nurture creativity, pique academic interest, and develop an altruistic mindset.

            <br><br> 

            As we regress further and further into our smartphones and mobile devices, we must still consider the positive net impact 
            that a public library holds, not just for accessibility, but for the promotion of a scholarly and communal mindset for our youth.

            With that in mind, how does the current public library landscape look for LA County?
